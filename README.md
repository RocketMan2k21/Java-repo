# Cubic Splines
The Cubic Splines module calculates linear and cubic interpolations based on a defined set of points. It provides methods to perform interpolation using cubic spline algorithms, enabling users to efficiently approximate values between data points.

# Merge File Sorter
The Merge File Sorter module implements the merge sort algorithm to sort binary data files. It efficiently sorts large datasets by dividing the data into smaller chunks, sorting them individually, and then merging them back together. This sorter is particularly useful for handling large volumes of data with minimal memory requirements.

# Dense Index Database
The Dense Index Database is designed for storing integer values efficiently. It utilizes a dense index structure to facilitate fast retrieval of values based on their integer keys. This database system offers optimized performance for applications requiring frequent integer value lookups
